	                Lunch Box Company was set up in 2014 reflecting a long-held vision of the company founder, Spencer Bloomfield. Spencer was looking for a service to provide a healthy and nutritious diet that reflected his active and busy lifestyle. But he could find nothing on the market to fulfil his requirements. So, as a trained chef and fitness fanatic, he decided to create his own.

	                Lunch Box uses insulated coolers and ice packs to ship to our clients in all 50 United States. Upon arrival, your fresh meals can be refrigerated and enjoyed from there! All meals are separated into categories on the menu for our clients' convenience. We offer Traditional Balanced Nutrition (for our clients who would like to maintain a healthy lifestyle) meals, Paleo meals (for our Paleo clients), and Competition meals (for our clients who are looking to lose weight). Fuel Food also offers cold-pressed juices, items for at-home meal preparation and supplements

	                    Lunch Box is one of the essential keys to eating healthfully. (I talked about meal planning in my Steps to Healthier Eating.) It ensures that you’ll have the ingredients on-hand to make what you want and takes the stress out of dinner time. Not to mention, it generally saves you money! I’ve put together a list of my favorite meal-planning services that focus on real ingredients and quick meals that are family-friendly.  Never wander the grocery store again!<br><br>
	                    We're constantly being bombarded with information about fad diets, points systems, magic potions, supplements and wonder diets - all promising rapid weight loss. But should we fall for the marketing hype? Well, if a diet means you're eating a lot less than you should, you'll probably begin to lose weight. But is it healthy? At Yolo, we don't believe so.<br><br>
	                    When you start to feel constantly tired, sluggish and hungry, you struggle to stay the course. You'll simply want the self-torture to end! In all likelihood, your good intentions fail and you end up gaining twice the amount of weight you lost. There is a better way. It's not about dieting and calorie restrictions, it's about changing your eating habits, more of a lifestyle choice. You just need to eat more of the right things. Your body will soon respond positively - you'll quickly begin to lean out and become healthier. Most importantly, if your food is tasty and satisfying, sustaining your healthy eating choice won't be a chore, it'll be a pleasure!
